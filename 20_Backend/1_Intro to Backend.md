Intro to Backend
• A request is sent to the desired IP address via HTTP
• Your request holds information (including your own IP address)
• Browser renders the content

Static vs. Dynamic webpages
• Dynamic website -- different HTML javascript sent back every time

A Generic Stack (all of the tech that a web app uses)

HTTP in Depth (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)
getpostman.com -- also devs to create and send HTTP requests
Requests can be made from all different places (browsers, command line, apps, backend)

HTTP Verbs (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
Tell the server "what we're doing with the request"
POST - Posting new information to a databse
GET - asking for data to come back
PUT/PATCH - Ammend a post request
DELETE - pretty self-explanatory

Three important parts of every response
Body - HTML/CSS/Javascript
Headers - Metadata about the response
	e.g. content-type (E.g. HTML)
Status code - part of the protocol (e.g. 200 = good, 404 = bad), in the header

Query String - GET requests can be sent with a search term (e.g. "corgis"); always starts after a "?"
